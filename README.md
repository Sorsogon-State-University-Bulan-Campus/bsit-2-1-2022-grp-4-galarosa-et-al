# FASHION WEBSITE - RJC SHOP

# Description
Amidst all the complexities involved in running an Online Fashion Store, retailers tend to forget that at the end of the day it’s about selling. They spend money on inventory, building a website, fulfillment, and marketing to bring people to their website, only to show them products with cookie-cutter descriptions. Gone are the days when a visitor would order from a website for convenience and lack of choice. Leveraging Fashion eCommerce Marketing services, thousands of new eCommerce websites are popping every day, hence customers today are rather spoiled for choice. If you don’t do a good job in describing your product, somebody else will. That’s why we get surprised when we see retailers who’re more worried about the color of the ‘Add to Cart’ button than the product description. 

# What is the purpose of this project?
Enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices.
